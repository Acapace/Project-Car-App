## Project-Car-App:

## I created a CRUD application for the car community and anyone who shares the same passion as myself. When building a project-car it is important to be able to keep track of the tasks and parts you need to accomplish your build. Being able to bring your dream car to reality in an easy, fun way!

## I used Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, EJS, Javascript, CSS, and boostrap to create this CRUD APP.

## I n this App the main page has an Inventory list where there is a button that will allow you to add new inventory to your list. When clicking this it will bring you to a new page with a form ready for your inventory to be added in. Below there is the list itself with the labeled task/Item with a detail button that will direct you to a new page to see more details.

## On the New Inventory Page: I had created a form that you can input a new Task/Item, Work done by or the vendor, the cost of the task/item, the time frame for the work to be done by, a description, along with two checkboxes of purchased and installed showing if the item is true or false in the purchase/install. Once submitting you will be redirected back to the home page.

## On the Detail Page you will see more details of the current task or item you had chosen to look at. This page allows you to edit or delete. Also a button allowing you to go back to the homepage

## The Nav bar has a link that will take you to a PROJECTS page, showing you a project gallery of my personal projects. Also a button to take you back to the  homepage.

## I would like to make this a social site and allow other to add in their projects to share Inventory, Photos, and as question/answer page to help others with their build. I would like to add a media page where other can upload videos of races and car meets and a page to post and sell inventory such a car parts, clothings and so on.
